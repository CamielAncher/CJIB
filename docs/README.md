## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources to detect and analyze fraudulent activities using license plate detection and processing techniques. It leverages:
- **Azure Blob Storage**: To store and manage plate recognition data.
- **Plate Detection Algorithms**: For extracting license plates from images.
- **Python Scripts**: To automate data handling, detection, and reporting.

The project is structured to facilitate further development and experimentation in fraud detection systems using machine learning and cloud-based architectures.
