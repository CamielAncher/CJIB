🚗 Fraud Detection with Plate Recognition
Welcome to the Fraud Detection with Plate Recognition project! This internal tool is designed to identify potential fraudulent license plates by checking for missing "NL" identifiers. Built using Azure services and Python, this repository is a secure and private workspace for development and testing purposes.

⚠️ Important Notice
This repository contains sensitive information, including API keys and Azure configurations. It is intended for private use only and must not be made public to ensure the security of the credentials.

Keep this repository private.
Never share keys or credentials outside the team.
Regularly rotate sensitive keys and update them in the scripts.
📖 Project Overview
The main purpose of this project is to:

Analyze license plate images stored in Azure Blob Storage.
Use Azure Computer Vision to extract text from the images.
Detect missing "NL" identifiers and flag them for further inspection.
The project is a foundation for exploring fraud detection techniques using cloud and AI services. While its current scope is limited to detecting missing "NL", it provides a scalable framework for future enhancements.

🚀 Features
Missing "NL" Detection: Identify license plates that do not contain the "NL" identifier.
Batch Processing: Analyze up to 200 images in one run.
Custom Plate Generation: Generate test license plate images with realistic anomalies.
Azure Integration: Leverage Azure Blob Storage and Computer Vision for scalability.
Simple Reporting: Log flagged anomalies in a text file for further inspection.
🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Azure Blob Storage account and container
Azure Computer Vision service
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the Repository (ensure your GitHub account has access to this private repo):

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/FraudDetectionPrivate.git
cd FraudDetectionPrivate

Install Dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Azure:

Create an Azure Blob Storage container.
Enable Azure Computer Vision and generate your subscription key and endpoint.
Add Configuration: Update the following in the scripts (ensure the keys are handled securely):

STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL
CONTAINER_NAME
subscription_key
endpoint
🔧 Usage
1. Detect Missing "NL"
Run the combined.py script to analyze license plates stored in Azure Blob Storage:

bash
Copy
Edit
python combined.py
This script will:

Analyze license plate images in the specified container.
Identify and flag plates missing the "NL" identifier.
Save flagged cases to Further inspection.txt in the Output folder.
2. Generate License Plates
Use the PlateGenerator.py script to create test license plate images:

bash
Copy
Edit
python PlateGenerator.py
The script will:

Generate images based on a blank template.
Use randomized text for testing.
Save plates in the Output/generated plates folder.

🌟 Current Workflow
Fraud Detection:
Upload Images: Store license plate images in Azure Blob Storage.
Analyze Plates: Extract text using Azure Computer Vision.
Check for "NL": Flag plates missing the "NL" identifier.
Log Anomalies: Save flagged cases to Further inspection.txt.
Custom Plate Generation:
Fetch real-world license plate data from the RDW Open Data API.
Generate test plates with randomized text.
Save test plates for further analysis.
🧪 Testing and Validation
Edge Cases: Test the system with plates that have obscured or missing "NL" identifiers.
Logs: Review Further inspection.txt for flagged anomalies.
🛠️ Future Plans
While the current system detects missing "NL", future improvements include:

Advanced Fraud Detection: Identify tampered or altered plates.
Pattern Validation: Check for invalid formats.
Machine Learning: Use trained models for more sophisticated detection.
Real-Time Processing: Add live data analysis capabilities.
🔒 Security Notes
Do not hardcode sensitive credentials in public environments.
Store keys and secrets securely (e.g., using environment variables or Azure Key Vault).
Rotate keys periodically and update your configuration.
